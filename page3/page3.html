            Stockholm is ranked ad The Most Sustainable Country in the World for many years and cycling around Stockholm is considered as one of
            the easiest and smartest way to discover the city. In the city there are many cycling lanes since people living in Stockholm are used 
            to use bikes for moving. <br>
            During summertime there are many organized bike tours that will allow you to see the most breathtaking sightseeing of the city. 
            You can find tours for both city centre as Gamla Stan or the nature around the city, such as the islands. <br>

            about the old town, one of the best and well preserved medieval city; the 18th-century Stockholm Palace, official residence of the Swedish 
            monarch; the Swedish Parliament and more. <br>
            Moreover there are tours for specific neighborhoods like Södermalm, known as the hippiest district of the city: there you can admire the 
            typical architecture, the many art galleries and the cozy atmosphere of the coffee shops. <br>
            Around the city there are many islands, highly preserved, with the real Swedish nature. One great example is the island of Djurgården where 
            you can explore the amazing landscapes and the typical house architecture riding on two wheels. The guide will explain about the history 
            of this island and its fauna and flora evolution. <br>
