            Biking is one of the easiest ways to get around Stockholm. Besides being environmentally friendly, it is often times faster and more flexible than public transport.
            The infrastructure for bycicles in Stockholm is fantastic - whether in the city centre or in the suburbs there are almost always wide bike paths separated from cars
            and pedestrians. In addition there are dedicated parking spaces and bike stands almost everywhere across town. Even air pump stations can be found in multiple places 
            so you can refill your tires for free to enjoy biking even more. As you see biking is the perfect way to exercise as well as explore Stockholm's beautiful capital all at once. <br><br>
